Report manager
==============

This app allows you to define customize reports.

A custom report is written as an SQL query, and it
supports all sorting, filtering and export features available
in the standard frePPLe reports.

This app adds a new menu for the custom reports. It also
adds `this screen <../user-interface/report-manager.html>`_
to add, edit and delete custom reports.
