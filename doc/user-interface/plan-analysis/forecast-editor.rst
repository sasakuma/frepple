The panel is split in two areas:

- | The top section of the screen allows easy navigation across the item, location,
    customer and time hierarchies. When an intersection is selected, the following
    dimensions and the bottom panel are immediately updated.
  | A first dropdown allows you to choose the order of the navigation dimensions.
    You can also choose to hide a dimension.
  | A second dropdown allows you choose which numbers should be displayed in the
    top panels.
  | The time buckets of the report can be configured with the clock icon.

The table in the forecast tab is for forecast tunning. Adjustments can be made and will have
an immediate impact on the graph above the table.

Here is a description of the standard measures that are available on the forecast table. You can add
custom rows to the list as well by defining :doc:`../../model-reference/forecast-measures`.
