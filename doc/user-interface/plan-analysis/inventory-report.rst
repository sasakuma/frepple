Inventory report
================

The report shows per buffer and per time bucket the inventory profile:
the starting inventory, the material consumed, the material produced and
the ending inventory.

If the report is opened for a single buffer an inventory graph is displayed.

| The rows in the report are defined such that following equations apply:
|   **End inventory = Start inventory + Total produced â€“ Total consumed**
|   **Start inventory = End inventory of the previous time bucket**
|   **Total produced = Produced by MO + Produced by PO + Produced by DO**
|   **Total consumed = Consumed by MO + Consumed by DO + Consumed by SO**
