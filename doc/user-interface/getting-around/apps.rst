Extension apps
==============

FrePPLe has a modular architecture. There are a number of core modules,
and also a number of optional apps that provide new functionality.

Extensions can be provided by the frepple team,
`the frepple user community <https://github.com/frePPLe/frepple/discussions/>`_
or `developed by yourself <../developer-guide/creating-an-extension-app.html>`_.

Read more on the available extensions in `this chapter <../../apps/index.html>`_.

Only superusers can view the app list, and install or uninstall them.
