Parameter
=========

Global settings and parameters are stored here.

Some of these parameters are used by the planning algorithm, others are used
by the web application. Extension modules also add additional configuration
parameters to this table.

**Standard parameters**

The table below shows the parameters that are recognized by the standard
application.

==================================== =======================================================================
Parameter                            Description
==================================== =======================================================================
currentdate                          | Current date of the plan, preferred format is YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS
                                       but most known formats to represent a date and/or time are accepted.
                                     | When the parameter is set to "today", we use today 00:00 / midnight
                                       as the currrent date.
                                     | When the parameter is set to "now", we use the system time as current date.
                                     | If the parameter is missing, empty or has an uncognized format, the system
                                       time is also used as current date.
currency                             | Currency symbol.
                                     | This parameter may be only set on the default database and will be
                                       globally applied, including in all the scenarios.
                                     | If the parameter is missing or empty the currency symbol will be the $.
                                     | By default the symbol will show after the value, i.e. **123 $**.
                                     | For the symbol to show before the value a **,** should be added after the
                                      symbol, i.e. **$,**, resulting in **$ 123**.
loading_time_units                   | Time units to be used for the resource report.
                                     | Accepted values are: hours, days, weeks.
excel_duration_in_days               | Determines whether numbers in spreadsheets are considered
                                       as days or seconds. Default is true for days.
                                     | This parameter is only useful for backward compability.
plan.administrativeLeadtime          | Specifies an administrative lead time in days.
                                     | FrePPLe will plan the sales orders this amount of time ahead of their
                                       due date. This creates extra safety in the delivery schedule and also
                                       moves all material and capacity needs early.

                                     | The default value is 0 days, which is a just-in-time plan, where we try
                                       to plan all demands in **backward scheduling mode** from their due date.

                                     | Setting this parameter to a high value (eg 999) will result in a plan
                                       where everything is planned ASAP in **forward scheduling mode**.

plan.autoFenceOperations             | The number of days the solver should wait for a confirmed
                                       replenishment before generating a proposed order.
                                     | Default: 999 (wait indefinitely)
                                     | Default before release 5.0.0: 0 (don't wait)
plan.individualPoolResources         | Defines the behavior of aggregate resource.

                                     | A operation-resource record with quantity N for an aggregate resource
                                       can mean either:
                                     | - Find a member resource with size N. Value false, default.
                                     | - Find N member resources of size 1. Value true.
plan.minimalBeforeCurrentConstraints | By default the "why short or late" list for a sales order can include
                                       many operations as lead-time and release-fence constraints.
                                     | When setting this option to true, we will limit the list to show only
                                       the most constraining operation. This make the list easier to interpret
                                       by users.
plan.loglevel                        | Controls the verbosity of the planning log file.
                                     | Accepted values are 0 (silent â€“ default), 1 (minimal) and 2 (verbose).
plan.minimumdelay                    | Specifies a minimum delay the algorithm applies when the requested
                                       date isn't feasible.
                                     | The default value is 3600. This value should only be changed when the
                                       planning run is taking a long time and the log file shows that demands
                                       take many iterations to be planned - where the requested delivery
                                       date for each iteration is advancing only in tiny increments.
plan.fixBrokenSupplyPath             | When set to true (which is the default), frepple will scan for
                                       items that can't be replenished any longer with purchase orders,
                                       distribution orders or manufacturing orders.

                                     | FrePPLe automatically creates a dummy/fake supplier for such items.
                                       In this way broken supply paths are automatically fixed. Planners
                                       will need to review such dummy purchase orders and update the
                                       master data to replace them with the correct replenishment method.

                                     | When this parameter is set to false, broken supply paths will result
                                       in unplanned demand. Analysing the unplanned demand is in most cases
                                       more complex than reviewing the dummy purchase orders.
plan.rotateResources                 | When set to true, the algorithm will better distribute
                                       the demand across alternate suboperations instead of using
                                       the preferred operation.
plan.webservice                      | Specifies whether we keep the plan in memory as a web service for
                                       quick incremental planning. This functionality is only available in
                                       the Enterprise and Cloud Editions.
                                     | Accepted values are false and true (default).
COMPLETED.consume_material           | Determines whether completed manufacturing orders consume material
                                       or not.
                                     | Default is true.
COMPLETED.allow_future               | We assume that completed operations are always ending in the past.
                                       The planning engine will automatically adjust the end date to enforce
                                       this rule, unless this parameter is set to true.
                                     | Default is false.
WIP.consume_material                 | Determines whether confirmed manufacturing orders consume material
                                       or not.
                                     | Default is true.
WIP.consume_capacity                 | Determines whether confirmed manufacturing orders, purchase orders
                                       and distribution orders consume capacity or not.
                                     | Default is true.
WIP.produce_full_quantity            | Controls how material is produced from partially completed
                                       manufacturing orders.
                                     | When set to "false" (the default) a partially completed manufacturing
                                       order is producing only the remaining quantity of material. We assume
                                       that the on hand inventory has already been incremented to reflect
                                       the produced material.
                                     | When set to "true" a partially completed manufacturing ordre will
                                       still produce the full quantity of the material. We assume that the
                                       produced material will only be booked as inventory when the
                                       manufacturing order is fully finished.

                                                     | Default value: 0.05
inventoryplanning.horizon_end                        | Specifies the number of days in the future for which we generate safety
                                                       stock and reorder quantity values.
                                                     | Default: 365
inventoryplanning.horizon_start                      Specifies the number of days in the past for which we generate safety
                                                     stock and reorder quantity values. Default: 0
inventoryplanning.loglevel                           | Controls the verbosity of the inventory planning solver.
                                                     | Accepted values are 0(silent - default), 1 and 2 (verbose)
inventoryplanning.service_level_on_average_inventory | Flag whether the service level is computed based on the expected average
                                                       inventory. When set to false the service level estimation is based only
                                                       on the safety stock.

**Inventory rebalancing parameters**

==================================================== ===========================================================================
Parameter                                            Description
==================================================== ===========================================================================
inventoryplanning.rebalancing_burnout_threshold      | The minimum time to burn up excess inventory (compared to forecast) that
                                                       can be rebalanced (in days). If the burn out period (Excess Quantity /
                                                       Forecast) is less than the threshold, the rebalancing will not occur.
                                                     | Default value: 60
inventoryplanning.rebalancing_part_cost_threshold    | The minimum part cost threshold used to trigger a rebalancing. Parts with
                                                       a cost below the threshold will not be rebalanced.
                                                     | Default value: 100000
inventoryplanning.rebalancing_total_cost_threshold   | The minimum total cost threshold to trigger a rebalancing (equals to
                                                       rebalanced qty multiplied by item cost). Rebalancing requests with total
                                                       cost below the threshold will not be created.

**Report manager parameters**

==================================================== ===========================================================================
Parameter                                            Description
==================================================== ===========================================================================
report_download_limit                                | The maximum number of rows that are allowed to be downloaded with a
                                                       custom report. The limit protects against inefficient SQL report queries
                                                       that download excessive ammounts of data.
