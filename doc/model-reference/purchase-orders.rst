Purchase orders

This table contains the purchase orders of your supply chain (replenishment you are purchasing from your
suppliers), either proposed by frePPLe or confirmed.

This table is populated with new proposed purchase orders when frePPLe generates a plan.
It is also possible to load purchase orders that are already approved or confirmed in your ERP
system.

feasible         boolean           | Read-only boolean flag indicating whether the purchase order is violating any
                                     material, lead time or capacity constraints.

                                   | A criticality of 0 indicates that the purchase order is on the critical path of one or more demands.
                                   | Higher criticality values indicate a delay of the purchase order will not immediately impact the shipment of any demand.
                                   | A criticality of 999 indicates a purchase order that isnâ€™t used at all to meet any demand.
                                   | Note that the criticality is independent of whether the customer demand will be shipped on time or not.

                                   | The period of cover represents how long it will last until the last material of the purchase order will be consumed.
