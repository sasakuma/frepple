How can I adjust the forecast for a discontinued item?
======================================================

When an item is no longer for sale, you want its forecast to be zero.

You'll need to manually override the statistical forecast frePPLe
would compute based on the historical sales of the item.

1) Navigate to Forecast in the Sales menu.
2) Click on the search icon in the upper right corner and filter for your discontinued item(s).
3) Update the field in the Method column from Automatic to Manual. frePPLe stops forecasting them automatically.
4) Save your changes.
