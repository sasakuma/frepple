How can I filter out exceptional sales (outliers)?
==================================================

Exceptional, one-off big demand can significantly impact the forecast calculation.
A demand planner will need to monitor these outlier demands, and may apply some
correction to avoid skewing the forecast.

FrePPLe's forecasting algorithm automatically detects such outliers (by comparing
the actual demand with a range of the expected/forecasted value). An alert is created,
and you can easily drill down from the alert to a screen for analysis and correction of
the demand history.

1) Navigate to Problem Report in the Sales menu.
2) Click on the search icon in the upper right corner and filter for items whose "Name equals outlier."
3) Navigate to Forecast Editor and edit the outliers. You will spot them thanks to a warning sign in the total orders row.
