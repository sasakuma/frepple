How can I compare my own forecast with the forecast computed by frePPLe?
========================================================================

It's a common debate whether your manual forecast overrides are more
accurate than the statistical forecast computed by frePPLe.

We're not gonna enter the debate, but will just show you how you can review
both.

1) Navigate to Forecast Report in the Sales menu.
2) Click on the table icon in the upper right corner.
3) The Forecast baseline row contains the forecast computed by frePPLe.
4) The Forecast total row contains your forecast if you have provided an override. Otherwise, it's equal to the Forecast baseline.
5) The Forecast override is only populated if you have provided an override for that exact intersection of item-location-customer.
