=============================================
Create long term purchase plan for a supplier
=============================================

As part of their yearly or quarterly budgetting process your supplier can
request your material planner to provide a long term prediction of your purchasing intentions.

1) | Open the "purchase order summary" screen from the Purchasing menu.
2) | Filter for a specific supplier, and select the appropriate time horizon
     and time buckets.
3) | Use the wrench icon to display the rows you want to display in the report.
   | Most suppliers want to see the "receipt date" in the report, but
     some may want to see the "ordering date".
   | There are also rows to show the new purchase orders (as opposed to the
     purchase orders you already placed).
4) | Click on the arrow icon to download the report as an Excel or CSV file.
