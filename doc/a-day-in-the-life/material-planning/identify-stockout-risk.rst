How can I identify and review items with stockout risk?
=======================================================

You'll always have some item - locations where demand is higher than expected and
your're running low on inventory (or even out of stock).

FrePPLe identifies these item-locations by their inventory status: it evaluates
the inventory against the safety stock, both at the current date and one lead time
ahead.

Material planners will want an overview of these critically short item-locations:
Maybe you can expedite the replenishment? If not, you'll want to notify the sales
team of the shortages.

1) Navigate to Inventory Planning in the Inventory menu.
2) Remove all grouping and segment.
3) Click on the Inventory Status column to sort results by inventory status ascending.
4) The cells in red are more likely to face stockouts.
