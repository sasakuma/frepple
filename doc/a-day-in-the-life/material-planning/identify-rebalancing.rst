How can I identify inventory rebalancing requests?
==================================================

In a network with many items and many locations, you'll invariably end up in situations
where one location is running low on inventory for an item while another location has
excess inventory.

FrePPLe's planning algorithm will identify such situations and can automatically
propose distribution orders to move some inventory and rebalance the network.

Material planners will want an overview of these proposals. After reviewing and
approving they bring the rebalancing distribution orders to the ERP for execution.

1) Navigate to Distribution Orders in the Inventory menu.
2) Click on the search icon in the upper right corner and filter for Destination equals name of warehouse or distrition center.
