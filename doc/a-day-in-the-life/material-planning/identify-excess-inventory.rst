Where can I find stock excess situations?
=========================================

Inevitably you'll have situations where a certain item-location has an excessive
inventory.

These can be identified by their "period of cover": an item-location that has
enough inventory to cover the expected demand for the next 2 years is definetely
overstocked, isn't it?

A material planner will monitor such overstock situations, and eventually take
corrective actions.

1) Navigate to Inventory Report in the Inventory menu, or the Demand Report in the Sales menu.
2) Use the "period of cover" field to filter and/or sort by the excess.
   The "period of cover" is computed as the moment the last unit of your current inventory will be used up.
