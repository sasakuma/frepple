How can I review the inventory situation of an item across my network?
======================================================================

In a complex distribution network you'll have inventory of an item at multiple
locations. A material planner often needs to check the inventory and supply
situation of an item across all these locations.

1) Navigate to Inventory Report in the Inventory menu.
2) Click on the search icon in the upper right corner and filter for the item-location you want to check.
3) Click on the clock icon and select day as bucket size, then set it to 1 month after plan current date.
4) Click on the wrench key icon and select the crosses (rows) you wish to display.
5) The report contains the current inventory on hand and its evolution in the next 30 days.
