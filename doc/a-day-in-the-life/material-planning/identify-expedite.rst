How can I detect purchase orders that need expediting?
======================================================

Some purchase orders you already have placed with your suppliers will be received too late.
Their late arrival will delay the shipment of some customer orders.

A material planner wants an overview of such purchase orders, and (if you're lucky)
the supplier can expedite their delivery.

1) Navigate to Purchase Orders in the Purchasing menu.
2) Click on the Inventory Status column to sort the orders by inventory status ascending.
3) The cells in red need expediting.
4) The safety stock of the item-location they replenish will be either partially or totally consumed in one lead time from current date.
