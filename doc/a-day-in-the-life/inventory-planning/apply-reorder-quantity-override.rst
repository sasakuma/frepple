How can I apply a reorder quantity (ROQ) rule to one item-location?
===================================================================

Frepple computes a safety stock and reorder quantity across a large network
with many item & location. Occasionally there will be situations where the
inventory planner wants to override the system proposals: for instance items
phasing in or out, exceptionally expensive items, locations phasing in or out...

1) Navigate to Inventory Policies in the Inventory menu.
2) Click on the search icon in the upper right corner and filter for the item-location you wish to edit.
3) You can alos create a new record using the + icon.
4) Set a minimum and/or maximum ROQ rule and save.
