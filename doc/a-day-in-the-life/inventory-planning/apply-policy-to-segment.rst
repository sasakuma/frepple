Can I define the same inventory policies for a group of item-locations?
=======================================================================

Managing inventory policies for every item - location combination individually
becomes unmanageable if you need control thousands of items across hundreds of
locations.

Luckily frePPLe provides you a mechanism to manage the inventory policies
at an aggregate level: segments define a collection of item-locations
based on their attributes, and business rules associate an inventory policies
to all item-locations in a segment.

1) Navigate to Segments in the Inventory menu.
2) Click on the + icon in the upper right corner to add a new segment.
3) Navigate to "Business Rules" in the Inventory menu.
4) Add a new business rule to the segment you've just created...
