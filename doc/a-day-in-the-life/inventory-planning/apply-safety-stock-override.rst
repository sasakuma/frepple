How can I apply a fixed safety stock to one item-location?
==========================================================

Frepple computes a safety stock and reorder quantity across a large network
with many item & location. Occasionally there will be situations where the
inventory planner wants to override the system proposals: for instance items
phasing in or out, exceptionally expensive items, locations phasing in or out...

1) Navigate to Inventory Policies in the Inventory menu.
2) Click on the search icon in the upper right corner and filter for one specific item and location combination.
3) Input the same value in the safety stock minimum and maximum quantity columns for a fixed safety stock quantity.
4) Save your changes.
