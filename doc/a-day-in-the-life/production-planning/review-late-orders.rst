======================================
How can I spot and review late orders?
======================================

Production planners and your sales team always monitor the open sales orders
that risk not be ready by the customer due date.

Production planners need a good overview of these late orders, and a analysis
on the cause of the delay: Are you running short of capacity? Do you need to wait
for some raw materials to arrive?

1) Navigate to Sales Orders screen in the Sales menu.
2) Click on the search icon in the upper right corner and filter for status not equal closed.
3) Click on the Delay column to sort the orders by delay descending.
4) For each late order, drill down into details by clicking on the pointing triangle in the Name column.
5) Then, pick the "Why short or late?" tab in the upper right corner to check why it's late.
