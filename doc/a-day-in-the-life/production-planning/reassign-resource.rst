How can I change the assigned resource for a manufacturing order?
=================================================================

Some manufacturing orders can be produced on different resources.
FrePPLe's planning algorithm will automatically choose one of the
alternatives. As a planner you can manually override this choice.

1) Navigate to Manufacturing Orders in the Manufacturing menu and select the manufacturing order you wish to edit.
2) In the bottom panes, look for the Resources widget.
3) Select the new resource you wish to assign to the manufacturing order and save.
