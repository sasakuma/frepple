How can I update my plan when a machine breaks down?
====================================================

It happens... A critical resource is broken and will not be available for some time.

The production planner quickly wants a new production plan to reflects this new
reality.

1) Navigate to Resources in the Capacity menu.
2) Click on the search icon in the upper right corner and filter for your machine.
3) If the machine maximum calendar field is not populated, simply set the maximum field to 0.
4) If the maximum calendar is populated, edit the calendar and make sure the default value is 0 and all the calendar buckets also have a value of 0.
5) Relaunch the plan.
