How can I track down bottleneck resources?
==========================================

Some resources in your factory are bottlenecks. Others will have plenty of
idle time.

As a production planner you want a good overview of the bottleneck resources
and you'll closely monitor the plan of these critical resources.
Bottlenecks can vary over time and you want an early warning on upcoming capacity
shortages.

1) Navigate to Resource report in the Capacity menu.
2) Click on the clock icon in the upper right corner to adjust the buckets.
3) Click on the Utilization column to sort the resources by utilization descending.
