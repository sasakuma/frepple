=====================
Review critical items
=====================

You want to get a good overview of all problematic end items in your
portfolio, i.e. items for which your supply can't follow the demand.

You want to see to evolution of the backlogged demand over time.

1) | Open the "demand report" from the sales menu.
2) | There are a number of useful item attributes you can use to bring the
     critical items at the top of the list: "count of late demands", "quantity of late demands",
     "value of late demand", "count of unplanned demand", "quantity of unplanned demand"
     and "value of unplanned demand".
   | Customize the report to display one (or more) of these, and click the
     column header to order the report by this field.
3) | In the report the backlogged demand is visualized as a black line. Hopefully the line goes
     down to 0 very quickly...
4) | Hovering your mouse over a time bucket shows a summary of the supply and demand in that
     bucket.
   | If there is backlog during that bucket you also see a list of the constraints that cause
     the backlog: are you running out of capacity on some resources? Or are you waiting for
     supplier to ship you materials?
