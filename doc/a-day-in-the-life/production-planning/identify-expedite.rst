How can I detect manufacturing orders that need expediting?
===========================================================

Some manufacturing orders in the schedule can be planned late, while some others are
on time or early. Late manufacturing orders will cause late deliveries of sales orders
to your customers.

As a production planner you want a good visibility on the urgency and lateness of
the production orders.

1) Navigate to Manufacturing Orders in the Manufacturing menu.
2) Click on the search icon in the upper right corner and click on Reset to remove all filters.
3) Click on the Inventory Status column to sort the orders by inventory status ascending.
4) The cells in red show the orders that need to be expedited.
