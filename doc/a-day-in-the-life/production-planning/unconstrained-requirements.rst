How do I review the unconstrained capacity requirements?
========================================================

Frepple can generate constrained and unconstrained plans.

The production plan is normally run with in finite capacity, respecting the
availability of your resources.

For reviewing the long term capacity needs or to evaluate overtime possibilities,
the production planner may want to generate a plan with infinite capacity.

1) Navigate to execute in the Admin menu.
2) Execute a constrained plan but make sure that the capacity constrained is unchecked.
3) Navigate to Resource report in the Capacity menu and review capacity consumption.
4) Note that you can also control the finite / infinite planning per individual resource.
   It's not uncommon to generate a production plan where some of your resources are not
   considered as a constraint.
