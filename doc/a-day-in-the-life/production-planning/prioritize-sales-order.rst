to the sales orders orders with the highest priority and closest due date.

1) Navigate to Sales Orders in the Sales menu.
2) Click on the search icon in the upper right corner and filter for the sales orders you want to prioritize.
3) Update the priority column and save. Note that top priority is 1 in frePPLe.
