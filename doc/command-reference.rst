Planning workflows
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _runplan:

Generate a plan
---------------

This option runs the frePPLe planning engine with the input data from the
database. The planning results are exported back into the database.

Two main plan types can be distinguished, based on whether you want to
see demand OR material, lead time and capacity problems to be shown.

* A **constrained plan** respects all enabled constraints. In case of shortages
  the demand is planned late or short. No any material or capacity shortages
  are present in the plan.

* An **unconstrained plan** shows material, capacity and operation problems
  that prevent the demand from being planned in time. The demand is always met
  completely and on time.

In both the constrained and unconstrained plans you can select which constraints
are considered during plan creation:

* | Capacity:
  | Respect the capacity limits of your resources.

* | Manufacturing lead time:
  | Don't generate any manufacturing or distribution orders that start or end in the past.
  | Only confirmed manufacturing and distribution orders are allowed in the past, as these
    are considered frozen.
  | All approved and proposed manufacturing and distribution orders must start in the future.

* | Purchasing lead time:
  | Don't generate any purchase orders that start or end in the past.
  | Only confirmed purchase orders are allowed in the past, as these
    are considered frozen.
  | All approved and proposed purchase orders must start in the future.

A separate page provides more details on the :doc:`/developer-guide/planning-algorithm`.

.. _scheduletasks:

Group and schedule tasks
------------------------

With this option a user can execute a sequence of steps together as a group.

The execution of the task group can be triggered manually. Or it can be scheduled automatically
based on a predefined schedule.

Optionally, a email can be sent out upon failure or success of the execution.

The start time of a scheduled task is saved in the database with a fixed UTC offset.
As a consequence, planners living in countries where daylight saving time (DST) applies
will notice a one-hour difference for the scheduled task start depending on whether DST is active or not.

        POST /execute/api/scheduletasks/?schedule=my_task_sequence

.. _exportworkbook:

Export a spreadsheet
--------------------

This task allows you to download the complete model as a single spreadsheet
file. The spreadsheet can be opened with Excel or Open Office.

A separate sheet in the workbook is used for each selected entity.

The exported file can be imported back with the task described just below.

Optionally, you can make your dataset anonymous during the export to hide
sensitive company data. All entities then get a new name during the export. It remains
ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY to carefully review the generated spreadsheet and to remove
any sensitive data that is still left, such as descriptions, categories, custom
attributes, cost information.

.. _importworkbook:

Import a spreadsheet
--------------------

This task allows you to import an Excel spreadsheet.

A separate sheet in the workbook is used for each selected entity.

The sheet must have the right names - in English or your language. The first row
in each sheet must contain the column names.

.. _exporttofolder:

Export plan result
------------------

This task allows exporting data to a set of files in CSV or Excel format.
The purpose of this task is to help the exchange of information with other systems.

The command can easily by customized to export the results you need.

The files are all placed in a folder UPLOADFILEFOLDER/export/, which can be configured
per scenario with the UPLOADFILEFOLDER value in the djangosettings.py file.

The exported files can be accessed from the user interface, or through over a
HTTP(S) web interface.

        # Retrieve all exported files:
        GET /execute/downloadfromfolder/1/

        # Retrieve the list of all available files, with their size and timestamp
        GET /execute/uploadtofolder/1/

.. _emailreport:

Publish reports by email
------------------------

Reports that have been exported using *Export plan result* command can be
emailed to one or more recipients.

Recipients have to be separated by a comma in the *Emails* field.

Selected reports are zipped into a *reports.zip* file that is attached to the email.

In order to have this command working, the EMAIL parameters in the djangosettings.py
file must be properly configured.

      .. code-block:: bash

        POST /execute/api/emailreport/?recipient=recipient1,recipient2...&report=report1,report2,report3...

.. _uploadreport:

Publish reports by FTP
----------------------

Reports that have been exported using *Export plan result* command can be
pushed to a server using a ftp, ftps or sftp connection.

In order to have this command working, the FTP parameters in the djangosettings.py
file must be properly configured.
Note that, if you are using the SFTP protocol, the destination server needs to be added
to the known_hosts file.

   .. tab:: Web API

      .. code-block:: bash

        POST /execute/api/uploadreport/?report=report1,report2,report3...


.. _importfromfolder:

Import data files
-----------------

This task allows importing data from a set of CSV-formatted files (eventually GZ-compressed).
The purpose of this task is to help the exchange of information with other systems.

The files are all placed in a folder that is configurable per scenario with the
UPLOADFILEFOLDER in the djangosettings.py configuration file. The log file records
all data imports, in addition to any data errors identified during their processing.

The data files to be imported must meet the following criteria:

* | The name must match the data object they store: eg demand.csv, item.csv, item.xlsx, item.csv.gz
  | This is important for frePPLe to understand the correct processing order of the files.

* | Multiple files for the same entity can be provided. They will be processed in alphabetical order:
    eg "demand (1).xlsx", "demand (2).csv", "demand.1.csv", "demand.2.csv", "demand.extra.xlsx", "demand.postprocessing.sql"

* | The first line of the file should contain the field names. The field name can be in English
    or the default language configured with the LANGUAGE_CODE setting.

The following file formats are accepted:

  * | **Excel**:
    | The file name must end with .xlsx or .xlsm

  * | **CSV**:
    | The file name must end with .csv (or .csv.gz when compressed with gzip).
    | Some specific notes on the CSV format:

    * The separator in your CSV-files varies with the chosen language: If in your
      language a comma is used as a decimal separator for numbers, the CSV file
      will use a semicolon (;) as delimiter. Otherwise a comma (,) is used.
      See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal_mark

    * | The date format expected by frePPLe is 'YYYY-MM-DD hh\:mm\:ss' (international style).
      | Using the DATE_STYLE setting in the djangosettings.py file this can be changed
        to 'DD-MM-YYYY hh\:mm\:ss' (European style) or 'MM-DD-YYYY HH\:mm\:ss' (US style).

    * The data file is expected to be encoded in the character encoding defined by
      the setting CSV_CHARSET (default UTF-8).

  * | **PostgreSQL copy files**:
    | The file name must end with .cpy (or .cpy.gz when compressed with gzip).
    | Uploading in this format goes MUCH quicker than the other formats. It has some
      limitations however: a) the validation of the input data is not as extensive
      as the other formats, b) a single faulty record will abort the upload and c)
      it only supports adding new records and not updating existing records.
    | This method is therefore only recommended for loading very large data files
      with clean data.

  * | **SQL**:
    | The file name must end with .sql (or .sql.gz when compressed with gzip).
    | For security reasons these statements are executed as a database role
      with a minimal set of database permissions.
    | The setting DATABASES / SQL_ROLE refers to this role, and your database
      administrator needs to grant appropriate access rights to that role.

The execution screen displays the list of uploaded files. You can download
a file (or all files) by clicking on the arrow down button. You can also delete a
file by clicking on the red button.
The arrow up button will give the user the possibility of selecting multiple files
to upload to that folder.

This capability requires superuser privileges. The ability to view or upload files
bypasses the access rights configured in the application, so we need to keep the
access to the files restricted.

.. _runwebservice:

Web service
-----------

This action starts or stop the frepple web service which keeps the plan
in memory. The web service normally starts automatically, and the use of this
command is more an exception.

        POST /execute/api/stopwebservice/

.. _scenario_copy:

Scenario management
-------------------

Scenarios are isolated databases that allow working with multiple datasets.
See :doc:`/user-interface/what-if-scenarios` for an quick introduction.

This action allows a user to either create copies of a dataset into a
what-if scenario or promote the data from a scenario into *Production* database.

When the data is successfully copied, the status changes from 'Free'
to 'In use'. The access to the newly copied scenario is limited to 1) the
user who performed the copy plus 2) all superusers of the source scenario.

When the user doesn't need the what-if scenario any more, it can be released
again.

Releasing a scenario can be done from any scenario while copying and promoting
actions can only be performed from current scenario to destination scenario.

The label of a scenario, which is displayed in the dropdown list in the
upper right hand corner, can also be updated here.

The theme of the user interface can be different for each scenario. This avoids
confusion where changes are accidentily applied to an incorrect scenario.

.. _measure_copy:

Measure management
-------------------

This option allows a user to copy a measure into another measure.

The destination measure can be either a new measure or an existing measure (that will then be overwritten).

         POST /execute/api/measure_copy/?source=source_measure&destination=destination_measure

.. _backup:

Contact frePPLe support
-----------------------

This task should be used to share your data with the frePPLe support team.

This task dumps the contents of the current database schema to a backup file.

Important: The data in this backup file is **not** obfuscated. Your dataset will only
be used by the frepple developers solely for the purpose of analysing issues. The data
is not shared with any third party and will be destroyed after the issue analysis.

The file is created in the log folder configured in the configuration files
djangosettings.py. It can be downloaded from the browser and sent to the frePPLe support team.

For security reasons the command is only available to frePPLe superusers.

When executed, the command also removes dumps older than a month to limit the disk space usage.
If you want to keep dumps for a longer period of time, you'll need to copy the backup files
to a different location.

Administrator commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _loaddata:

Load a dataset in the database
------------------------------

A number of demo datasets are packaged with frePPLe. Using this action you can
load one of those in the database.

By default, the dataset is loaded incrementally in the database, **without** erasing any
previous data. A checkbox allows you to purge any existing data before loading
the dataset.

Another checkbox allows you to generate a plan after loading the dataset.

You can use the dumpdata command to export a model to the appropriate format
and create your own predefined datasets.

      .. code-block:: bash

        POST /execute/api/loaddata/?fixture=manufacturing_demo

.. _createbuckets:

Generate time buckets
---------------------

Many output reports are displaying the plan results aggregated into time
buckets. These time buckets are defined with the tables dates and bucket dates.

For all reports to work correctly and avoid all ambiguity you need to assure
the expressions generate a unique name for each bucket. For instance, just using
"%y" as day name won't work.

This tasks allows you to populate these tables in an easy way with buckets
with daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly and yearly granularity. Existing bucket
definitions for these granularities will be overwritten.

The following arguments are used:

* | Week start: Defines the first date of a week.
  | Sunday=0, Monday=1, Tuesday=2, Wednesday=3, Thursday=4, Friday=5, Saturday=6

* | Day name, week name, month name, quarter name, year name:
  | Template used to generate a name for the buckets.

  Any character can be used in the names and the following format codes can be used:

  - %a: Weekday as locale's abbreviated name. Eg: Sun, Mon, ...

  - %A: Weekday as locale's full name. Eg: Sunday, Monday, ...

  - %w: Weekday as a decimal number, where 0 is Sunday and 6 is Saturday.

  - %d: Day of the month as a zero-padded decimal number. Eg: 01, 02, ..., 31

  - %b: Month as locale's abbreviated name. Eg: Jan, Feb, ...

  - %B: Month as locale's full name. Eg: January, February, ...

  - %m: Month as a zero-padded decimal number. Eg: 01, 02, ..., 12

  - %q: Quarter as a decimal number. Eg: 1, 2, 3, 4

  - %y: Year without century as a zero-padded decimal number. Eg: 00, 01, ..., 99

  - %Y: Year with century as a decimal number. Eg: 2018, 2019, ...

  - %j: Day of the year as a zero-padded decimal number. Eg: 001, 002, ..., 366

  - %U: Week number of the year as a zero padded decimal number. Eg: 00, 01, ...

  - %W: Week number of the year as a decimal number. Eg: 0, 1, ...

  - %%: A literal '%' character.

.. _restore:

Restore a database backup
-------------------------

This command erases the existing content of a database and restores
the contents of a postgresql database dump file.

The database dump file can either be created with the :ref:`backup` command,
or with the PostgreSQL `pg_dump <https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-pgdump.html>`_
command. When using pg_dump, you need to use the "custom format".

        frepplectl changepassword user_name


.. _flush:

Remove all database objects
---------------------------

This command completely empties all tables in the database, including all log, users,
user preferences, permissions, etc...

A complete reset of the database is not very common. In most situations the command
described above to empty the database is sufficient. It empties the data tables,
but leaves the important configuration information intact.

   .. tab:: Command line

      .. code-block:: bash

        frepplectl flush


.. _generatetoken:

Generate an API token
---------------------

This command generates a JWT authentication token that can be used for API calls.

.. _dbshell:

Database shell prompt
---------------------

This command runs an interactive SQL session on the PostgreSQL database.

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Command line

      .. code-block:: bash

        frepplectl dbshell --database=default


.. _shell:

Python command prompt
---------------------

This command runs an interactive Python interpreter session.

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Command line

      .. code-block:: bash

        frepplectl shell


.. _dumpdata:

Dump a frozen dataset
---------------------

Outputs to standard output all data in the database (or a part of it).

When the output file of this command is placed in a fixtures subfolder
it can be used by the loaddata command described above. We recommend you
review and cleanse the output carefully, to avoid that the frozen dataset
contains unnecessary data.

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Command line

      .. code-block:: bash

        frepplectl dumpdata --database=scenario1


.. _test:

Run the test suite
------------------

Run the test suite for the user interface.

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Command line

      .. code-block:: bash

        frepplectl test freppledb


.. _runwebserver:

Run the Python web server
-------------------------

Runs a production web server for environments with very few users.
For a more scalable solution, deploying frePPLe on Apache with mod_wsgi is required.

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Command line

      .. code-block:: bash

        frepplectl runwebserver


.. _runserver:

Run the development web server
------------------------------

Run a development web server, which automatically reloads when code is changed.

For production use this web server doesn't scale enough.

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Command line

      .. code-block:: bash

        frepplectl runserver


.. _createmodel:

Generate a sample model
-----------------------

Populate the database with a configurable dataset. Command line arguments control
the depth and complexity of the bill of material, the number of resources and their
average load, the average lead times, the number of demands.

The command thus allows to quickly generate a sample model, and to verify its
scalability with varying size and complexity.

This command is intended for academic and research purposes. The script can
easily be updated to create sample models in the structure you wish.

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Command line

      .. code-block:: bash

        frepplectl createmodel --level=3 --cluster=100 --demand=10


.. _forecast_simulation:

Estimate historical forecast accuracy
-------------------------------------

This command estimates the forecast accuracy over the past periods.

This is achieved by turning back the clock a number of buckets ago. We compute
the forecast with the demand history we would have had available at that time.
Comparing the actual sales and the forecasted sales in that period allows us
to measure the forecast accuracy. This calculation is then repeated for each
bucket to follow.

This command is intended for academic and research purposes. The script can
easily be updated to perform more advanced forecast accuracy studies.

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Command line

      .. code-block:: bash

        frepplectl forecast_simulation


.. _simulation:

Simulate the execution of the plan
----------------------------------

This command simulates the execution of the plan. The command allows
detailed studies of the stability and robustness of the plan in the
presence of various disturbances.

The command iterates over a number of time periods and performs the following
steps in each period:

1. Advance the current date
2.  Call a custom function "start_bucket"
3. | Open new sales orders from customers
   | Custom code can be added here to represent the typical ordering pattern
     of customers, and the occasional rush orders.
4. Generate a constrained frePPLe plan
5. Confirm new purchase orders from the frePPLe plan
6. Confirm new production orders from the frePPLe plan
7. Confirm new distribution orders from the frePPLe plan
8. | Receive material from purchase orders
   | Custom code can be added here to simulate late or early deliveries
     from your suppliers.
9. | Finish production from manufacturing orders
   | Custom code can be added here to simulate production delays, machine breakdowns,
     rework and other production disturbances.
10. | Receive material from distribution orders
    | Custom code can be added here to simulate late or early deliveries between
      locations in the warehouse.
11. Ship open sales orders to customers
12. | Call a custom function "end_bucket"
    | This function will typically be used to collect performance statistics
      of the period just simulated.

This command is intended for academic and research purposes. The script needs to
be tailored carefully to model a realistic level of disturbances in your model
and collect the performance metrics that are relevant.
